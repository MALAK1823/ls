#Library Management System

This is a simple C++ project simulating a basic library system. It allows users to borrow and return books

#Features

- Add new books to the library
- Display list of all resources
- Borrow a book by ID (if available)
- Return a previously borrowed book
- Track borrowed items for a specific user

#OOP Concepts

- Inheritance (`Book` inherits from `Resource`)
- Polymorphism (virtual functions)
- Abstract classes
- Composition (`Library` has a `User`)
- Dynamic memory allocation
